) all even bits of x by bitwise and(&) of x with 0xAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. number 0xAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA is a 64-bit number  all even bits set as 1 and all odd bits as 0. 

2) all odd bits of x by doing bitwise and of x with 0x5555555555555555.  number 0x5555555555555555 is a 64-bit number  all odd bits set as 1 and all even bits as 0. 

3) Right shift all even bits and store  variable even.

4) Left shift all odd bits and store variable odd.

5) Combine new even and odd bits and return by bitwise oring both variables.
