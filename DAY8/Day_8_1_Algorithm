ALGORITHM:-

1.Pass two arg and 1 is return value, Ask input from the user (byte value and bit position).
2.Argument 1 can be byte value and argument 2 can be bit position in the byte value 
3. bit position can be left shifted with 1 and which can be stored in temperory variable as mask(fun has to flip to the bit position).
4.Then byte value xor with temperory variable mask that can store in binary value.
5.stored byte value can be store in another variable as result.
6.result value is the output.
